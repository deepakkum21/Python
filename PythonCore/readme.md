## Features of Python
01. Simple and Easy to learn
02. Freeware and open source
03. High level programming language
04. Platform Independent
05. Portability
06. Dynamically Typed
07. Both Procedure oriented and OOP (does not support method overloading but support operator overloading) i.e not fully OOP
08. Interpreted
09. Extensible
10. Embedded
11. Extensive support of libraries

## Flavours of Python
01. CPython -> C (CPythonVM)
    - This is the most widely accepted implementation of Python. 
    - It is written in the language C, and is an interpreter.
02. Jython or Jpython -> Java (JVM)
    - Jython is a Python implementation written in Java. 
    - A Jython program can import any Java class. 
    - It compiles to Java bytecode.
03. IronPython -> C# (CLR) 
    - IronPython is implemented in C#. 
    - It can function as an extensibility layer to application frameworks written in a .NET language.
04. PyPy(python for speed) -> Jit compiler inside PVM  
    - It is interesting to know that PyPy is Python implemented in Python. 
    - This makes it faster and easier to experiment with. 
    - However, the standard implementation is CPython.
05. RubyPython -> Ruby (Ruby VM)  
    - It acts as a bridge between the Python and Ruby interpreters. 
    - It marshals data between Python and Ruby virtual machines.
06. AnacondaPython -> Large volume of Data
07. StacklessPython -. Python for concurrency
08. Brython -> javascript (javascript interpreter(v8)
    - Brython stands for Browser Python. 
    - It is an implementation of Python that runs in the browser.
