| center()  | - Center the string within the specified width with optional fill character. | 
| count()  | - Count the non-overlapping occurrence of supplied substring in the string. | 
| encode()  | - Return the encoded version of the string as a bytes object. | 
| endswith()  | - Returns ture if the string ends with the supplied substring. | 
| expandtabs()  | - Return a string where all the tab characters are replaced by the supplied number of spaces. | 
| find()  | - Return the index of the first occurrence of supplied substring in the string. Return -1 if not found. | 
| format()  | - Format the given string. | 
| format_map()  | - Format the given string. | 
| index()  | - Return the index of the first occurrence of supplied substring in the string. Raise ValueError if not found. | 
| isalnum()  | - Return true if the string is non-empty and all characters are alphanumeric. | 
| isalpha()  | - Return true if the string is non-empty and all characters are alphabetic. | 
| isdecimal()  | - Return true if the string is non-empty and all characters are decimal characters. |

| islower()  | - Return true if the string has all lowercased characters and at least one is cased character. | 
| isnumeric()  | - Return true if the string is non-empty and all characters are numeric. | 
| isprintable()  | - Return true if the string is empty or all characters are printable. | 
| isspace()  | - Return true if the string is non-empty and all characters are whitespaces. | 
| istitle()  | - Return true if the string is non-empty and titlecased. | 
| isupper()  | - Return true if the string has all uppercased characters and at least one is cased character. | 
| join()  | - Concatenate strings in the provided iterable with separator between them being the string providing this method. | 
| ljust()  | - Left justify the string in the provided width with optional fill characters. | 
| lower()  | - Return a copy of all lowercased string. | 
| lstrip()  | - Return a string with provided leading characters removed. | 
| maketrans()  | - Return a translation table. | 
| partition()  | - Partition the string at first occurrence of substring (separator) and return a 3-tuple with part before separator, the separator and part after separator. | 
| replace()  | - Replace all old substrings with new substrings. | 
| rfind()  | - Return the index of the last occurrence of supplied substring in the string. Return -1 if not found. | 
| rindex()  | - Return the index of the last occurrence of supplied substring in the string. Raise ValueError if not found. | 
| rjust()  | - Right justify the string in the provided width with optional fill characters. | 
| rpartition()  | - Partition the string at last occurrence of substring (separator) and return a 3-tuple with part before separator, the separator and part after separator. | 
| rsplit()  | - Return a list of words delimited by the provided subtring. If maximum number of split is specified, it is done from the right. | 
| rstrip()  | - Return a string with provided trailing characters removed. | 
| split()  | - Return a list of words delimited by the provided subtring. If maximum number of split is specified, it is done from the left. | 
| splitlines()  | - Return a list of lines in the string. | 
| startswith()  | - Return true if the string starts with the provided substring. | 
| strip()  | - Return a string with provided leading and trailing characters removed. | 
| swapcase()  | - Return a string with lowercase characters converted to uppercase and vice versa. | 
| title()  | - Return a title (first character of each word capitalized, others lowercased) cased string. | 
| translate()  | - Return a copy of string that has been mapped according to the provided map. | 
| upper()  | - Return a copy of all uppercased string. | 
| zfill()  | - Return a numeric string left filled with zeros in the provided width. |
