## Description of Keywords in Python with examples
1. **True, False**
    - True and False are **truth values in Python**. 
    - They are the **results of comparison operations or logical (Boolean) operations** in Python. 
    - For example: 
    ![]()

    - **True and False in python is same as 1 and 0**. This can be justified with the following example:  
    ![]()   

2. **None**
    - None is a **special constant** in Python that **represents the absence of a value or a null value**.
