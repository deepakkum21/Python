# Flow Control
These decide the order in which the statement will be executed
1. Selection statement (if,elif,if else)
2. Iterartive statement (for, while )
3. Transfer statement (pass, continue, break)

1. **Selection Statement**
- when decision is made on some criteria.
    - **if** 
        - When it reaches an if statement, the computer only executes the body of the statement only if the condition is true.
    - **if condition: body  else : body**
        - if block is executed when condition evalutes to true otherwise else body is executed
    - **if condition: body elif condition : body  else : body**

2. **Iterative Statements**
- When want to execute a group of statement multiple times
    - **for loop**
        - for x in range(), list, tuple , string : do some action 
    - **while condition**
        - as long as the condition is true
        - when donot know the no of iteration in advance
        -  while condition : body
