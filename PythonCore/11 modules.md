2. it helps in code resuability .
3. A file containing Python code, for e.g.: **example.py, is called a module and its module name would be example**.
4. define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying their definitions into different programs.
5. Let us create a module. Type the following and save it as example.py.
