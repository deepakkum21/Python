# Python Generator
1. A Python generator is a **kind of an iterable**, like a Python list or a python tuple. 
2. It **generates for us a sequence of values that we can iterate on**. 
3. can use it to iterate on a for-loop in python, but you **can’t index it**.
4. Syntax:-
    -       def counter():
                i=1
                while(i<=10):
                    yield i
                    i+=1
    - we **use the yield statement**, inside a function, **instead of the return statement**
    -       for i in counter():
                print(i)

## Yielding into a Python List
- if we **apply the list() function to the call** to the Python generator, it will return a list of the yielded values, in the order in which they are yielded.
-           def even_squares(x):
                for i in range(x):
                    if i**2%2==0:
                    yield i**2
            
            print(list(even_squares(10)))

## Python List vs Generator in Python
- A **list holds a number of values at once**. But a Python **generator holds only one value at a time, the value to yield**. 
- This is why **generator needs much less space compared to a list**. 
- With a generator, we also **don’t need to wait until all the values are rendered**.

| **Python Generator** | **Function** |                                                                     
| -------------------- | ------------ |                                                                 
| It has yield keyword | it hmay or may not hasve return keyword |
| when interpreter reaches the Python yield statement in a generator, it yields the value to the iterable. Finally, it gets back to the generator to continue for the next value. | When the interpreter reaches the return statement in a function, it stops executing the Python Generator function and executes the statement after the function call. |
| when a Generator stops executing its local variables are not destroyed | when a function stops executing, its local variables are destroyed |

## Python Generator Expressions
- Just like a list comprehension, we can use expressions to create python generators shorthand. Let’s take a list for this
- **`(x**2 for x in [10,20,30])`**
