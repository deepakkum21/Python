# Operator Overloading 

- Using a operator for different purpose is called operator overlaoding (Java does not support)
- ' + ' operator can be used for addition , for string concatenation
- ' + ' operator is overloaded by both int  class and str  class.
    -  ` 3 + 5 `      output => 8 
    -  ` 'deepak' + 'kumar' `     output => deepakkumar
- ' * ' operator can be used in more than one form
    -  ` 3 * 5 `       output => 15
    -  ` 'deepak'*3 `  output => deepakdeepakdeepak

## '+' operator overloading using (__add__())
- eg
    -                   import math 
                        class Circle:
                        
                            def __init__(self, radius):
                                self.__radius = radius
                        
                            def setRadius(self, radius):
                                self.__radius = radius

                                return math.pi * self.__radius ** 2
                        
                            def __add__(self, another_circle):
                                return Circle( self.__radius + another_circle.__radius )
                        
                        c1 = Circle(4)
                        print(c1.getRadius())

                        print(c2.getRadius())
                        
                        c3 = c1 + c2 # This became possible because we have overloaded + operator by adding a    method named __add__
                        print(c3.getRadius())


    -                   class Book:

**Whenever we are printing any objectref / obj then `__str__(self)` will be called .If we are not providing this method then default implementation will be executed**

# Method Overloading & Constructor Overloading
- Both feature is not available in python as method overloading is valid for having different arg but in python there is no concept of type so no method overloading.
- If we declare multiple constructors or methods of same name and different arg , but it is **going to consider the last declare method or constructor**.
-                   class Test:
                    ''' Method Overloading not supported by python'''
                        def __init__(self);
                            print('constructor invoked for no arg')

                        def __init__(self, val);
                            print('constructor invoked for one arg')

                        def __init__(self, val1, val2);
                            print('constructor invoked for two arg')

                        def m1(self):
                            print('No arg Method executed')
                        
                        def m1(self, arg):
                            print('One arg Method executed')

                    test = test()  # invalid (since when multiple constructor are declared it is going to consider only last one)
                    test = test(5) # invalid (since when multiple constructor are declared it is going to consider only last one)
                    test = test(5,5) # valid (since when multiple constructor are declared it is going to consider only last one)
                    test.m1()      # type error m1() missing 1 positional arg since it is going to consider the last m1() and not first m1()

1. **arguments with different types**
-                   class Test:
                    ''' Demo for handling differnet types of arg'''
                        def m1(self, val)
                            print(val)

                    test = Test()
                    test.m1('deepak')
                    test.m1(20)
                    test.m1(20.5)
                    test.m1([10,2,5])
    - if above m1(self, val) method can handle all types of val so why there is need of method overloading

2. **different no of arguments**
-                   class Test:
                    ''' Demo for handling variable no of arg'''
                        def m1(self, *arg):
                            total = 0
                            for x in arg:
                                total = toatal + x
                            print ('the sum ',total)

                    test = Test()
                    test.m1(5)
                    test.m1(10,5,5)
                    test.m1()
                    test.m1(40,5,7,8,)
                    test.m1(5,4)
    - The above method m1(self, *arg) is the solution for need of having multiple method hanving differnet no of arg
