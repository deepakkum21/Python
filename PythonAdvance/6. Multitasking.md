# MultiThreading
1. Multitasking is of two types:
    - Process based multitasking where more than one process can be run parallelly
    - Thread based multitasking where a process is divided into many thread and are can simultaneously

## Multithreading
1. Where each thread is an independent part of the program
2. a flow of execution is known as thread
3. each thread has independent job to perform

## How to know the name of current thread
- threading module needs to be imported
- **threading.current_thread().getName()**
-                import threading
                 print('The Current Thread : ', threading.current_thread().getName())

## Creating Thread in Python
1. There are 3 ways by which we can create a thread
    - Creating a thread without using any class (Functional oriented way)
    - creating a thread by extending Thread class (OOP)
    - creating a thread without extending Thread class (OOP)

2. **Creating a thread without using any class (Functional oriented way)**
    -            from threading import *
                 def display():
                    for i in range(10):
                        print('Child thread: ',i+1)

                 childThread = Thread(target = display)        # creation of thread object to execute display
                 childThread.start()                           # start() enables to start the execution of thread object 
                 for i in range(10):     
                     print('Parent thread: ',i+1)

3. **Creating a thread by extending Thread class (OOP)**
    -            from threading import *
                 class MyThread(Thread)
                    # overriding run() of the Thread class
                    def run(self):
                        for i in range(10):
                            print('Child thread: ',i+1)

                 childThread = MyThread()                      # creation of thread object to execute display
                 childThread.start()                           # start() enables to start the execution of thread object 
                 for i in range(10):     
                     print('Parent thread: ',i+1)                     

4. **Creating a thread without extending Thread class (OOP)**
    -            from threading import *
                 class Test
                    def m1(self):
                        for i in range(10):
                            print('Child thread: ',i+1)
                 
                 test = Test()
                 childThread = Thread(target = test.m1())                      # creation of thread object to execute display
                 childThread.start()                                           # start() enables to start the execution of thread object 
                 for i in range(10):     
                     print('Parent thread: ',i+1)        


## How multithreading improves performance
- without multithreading
    -           import time
                def doubles(numbers):
                    for n in numbers:
                        time.sleep(1)
                        print('Double value: ', 2*n)
                def squares(numbers):
                    for n in numbers:
                        time.sleep(1)
                        print('Square value: ', n*n)

                numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
                beginTime = time.time()
                doubles(numbers)
                squares(numbers)
                endTime = time.time()
                print('Time taken to execute without multithreading: ', endTime - beginTime)        # roughly: 12sec

- with multithreading
    -           import time
                from threading import *
                def doubles(numbers):
                    for n in numbers:
                        time.sleep(1)
                        print('Double value: ', 2*n)
                def squares(numbers):
                    for n in numbers:
                        time.sleep(1)
                        print('Square value: ', n*n)

                numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
                beginTime = time.time()
                t1  = Thread(target = doubles, args = (numbers,))
                t2  = Thread(target = squares, args = (numbers,))

                t1.start()
                t2.start()

                t1.join()                                       #   wait untill t1 thread is completed
                t2.join()                                       #   wait untill t2 thread is completed

                endTime = time.time()
                print('Time taken to execute with multithreading: ', endTime - beginTime)           # roughly: 6sec   

## Setting and getting the name of the thread
1. **To get name**
    - threadObj.getName()   (incase of main thread, threadObj can be get by Thread.current_thread())
    - threadObj.name        (incase of main thread, threadObj can be get by Thread.current_thread())
2. **To set name**
    - threadObj.setName(newName)   (incase of main thread, threadObj can be get by Thread.current_thread())
    - threadObj.name = 'deepak'    (incase of main thread, threadObj can be get by Thread.current_thread())        


## To get identity no of a thread
- There is a special property or attribute of a threadObj called **ident** which return the unique identity no given to every thread vy PVM
- Every time a program is runned the value returned by ident may differ
- **threadObj.ident()**

## Some imp methods
1. **active_count()**
    - this returns the number of alive(currently) Thread objects. This is equal to the length the of the list that enumerate() returns.
    - `threading.active_count()`
    -   from threading import *
        active_count()
    -                   from threading import *
                        import time
                        def display():
                            print(current_thread().name,'...........started')
                            time.sleep(3)
                            print(current_thread().name,'...........ended')
                        print('The number of active Threads: ', active_count())      # 1
                        t1 = Thread(target = display, name = 'ChildThread-1')
                        t2 = Thread(target = display, name = 'ChildThread-2')
                        t3 = Thread(target = display, name = 'ChildThread-3')
                        t1.start()
                        t2.start()
                        t3.start()
                        print('The number of active Threads: ', active_count())       # 4
                        time.sleep(10)
                        print('The number of active Threads: ', active_count())       # 1
2. **enumerate()**
    - This returns a list of all alive(currently) Thread objects. 
    - This includes the main thread, daemonic threads, and dummy thread objects created by current_thread(). This obviously doesn’t include terminated threads as well as those that haven’t begun yet.
    - syntax:-   `threading.enumerate()`
    -                   from threading import *
                        import time
                        def display():
                            print(current_thread().name,'...........started')
                            time.sleep(3)
                            print(current_thread().name,'...........ended')
                        print('The number of active Threads: ', active_count())      # 1
                        t1 = Thread(target = display, name = 'ChildThread-1')
                        t2 = Thread(target = display, name = 'ChildThread-2')
                        t3 = Thread(target = display, name = 'ChildThread-3')
                        t1.start()
                        t2.start()
                        t3.start()
                        print('The number of active Threads: ', active_count())       # 4
                        listofthread = enumerate()
                        for thread in listofthread:
                            print('Thread name', thread.name)
                            print('Thraed dentity no ,'thread.ident)
                        time.sleep(10)
                        print('The number of active Threads: ', active_count())       # 1

3. **is_alive()**
    - This returns whether the thread is alive. is_alive() returns true from just before run() starts until just after it terminates.  
    - syntax:- `threading.Thread.is_alive(threading.current_thread())`
    -                   from threading import *
                        import time
                        def display():
                            print(current_thread().name,'...........started')
                            time.sleep(3)
                            print(current_thread().name,'...........ended')
                        print('The number of active Threads: ', active_count())      # 1
                        t1 = Thread(target = display, name = 'ChildThread-1')
                        t2 = Thread(target = display, name = 'ChildThread-2')
                        t3 = Thread(target = display, name = 'ChildThread-3')
                        t1.start()
                        t2.start()
                        
                        print(t1.name,' is alive: ', t1.is_alive())                    # true
                        print(t2.name,' is alive: ', t2.is_alive())                   # true
                        time.sleep(10)
                        print(t1.name,' is alive: ', t1.is_alive())                    # false
                        print(t2.name,' is alive: ', t2.is_alive())                   # false 

4. **join(timeout=None)**
    - if a thread wants to wait untill completion of some other thread
    - syntax    `threadObj_forwhichwanttowait.join()  `
    -                   from threading import *
                        import time
                        def display():
                            for i in range(10):
                                print('Child thread executing')
                                time.sleep(3)         
                        
                        childThreadref = Thread(target = display)
                        childThreadref.start()
                        childThreadref.join()              # main thread wants to wait for childThreadref till it completes its execution
                        childThreadref.join(10)            # main thread wants to wait for childThreadref till it completes its execution, if not then for 10nanosec
                        for i in range(10):
                            print('Main thread executing')

## Daemon threads
1. These are the threads which work in the background to provide support for the non-daemon threads(eg main thread)                        
2. GC is eg of daemon thread
3. imp methods and attributes:-
    - **isDaemon()** or **daemon**
    - to check wheather a given thread is a daemon thread or not
    - return boolean , true if the threadRef whichnis calling id=s daemon thread else returns false
    -                  from threading import *
                       mainThread = current_thread()
                       print(mainThread.isDaemon())  
                       print(mainThread.daemon) 
    - **threadRef.setDaemon(boolean)**
    - to make a non daemon thread to daemon and vice versa
    - **this has to be executed before a thread is started i.e. before start() is called on that thread, this concludes that main thread can never become daemon thread**
4. Daemon nature for a thread is **inherited from parent thread**
        -               from threading import *
                        import time
                        def job1():
                            print('executed by t1')    
                            t2 = Thread(target = job2)
                            print('t2 is daemon: ',t2.daemon)
                            t2.start()
                        
                        def job2():
                            print('executed by t2')                            

                        t1 = Thread(target = job1)
                        t1.setDaemon(true)
                        print('t1 is daemon: ',t1.daemon)
                        t1.start()
                        time.sleep(10)
5. Whenever the **last non-daemon thread terminates automatically all daemon threads will be terminated** we are not required to terminate it explicitly.
6. Supporting jobs can be implemented by daemon threads whereas main jobs can be implemented using daemon threads.
