# CSV operations
1. **csv module** has the related functionality for csv operations.
2.              import csv
                with open('filename.csv', 'r') as csv_file:
                    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)          # returns csv_reader object by default delimiter is ,(comma)
                next(csv_reader)                               # if wnat to skip the first line i.e. the heading
                 for line in csv_reader:
                    print(line)                                # prints the each line as list with col as elements of each list
                    print(line[2])                             # prints the 3rd col from each list

3. To read a csv file and write into another csv file with changing the delimiter from the , to  -
    -           import csv
                with open('filename.csv', 'r') as csv_file:
                    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)

                with open('newfile.csv', 'w') as new_csv_file:
                    csv_writer = csv.writer(new_csv_file, delimiter = '-')         # by default delimiter is , but can be used '\t'
                    for line in csv_writer:
                        csv_writer.writerow(line)                         # it write the data using - delimiter but if some col conatins -as data to distinguish                                                                 between col it encloses it with "" i.e.(deepak-kumar becomes "deepak-kumar") 

4. To use DictReader and DictWriter instead of reader and writer to read and wriet from the csv file
    -           import csv
                with open('filename.csv', 'r') as csv_file:
                    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)

                with open('newfile.csv', 'w') as new_csv_file:
                    fieldnames = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'email']           # this list will contain the name of the header or key for each value of each line
                    csv_writer = csv.writer(new_csv_file,fieldnames = fieldnames, delimiter = '-')   
                    csv_writer.writerheader(fieldnames)                 # to write the haeders from fieldnames

                    for line in csv_writer:
                        del line['email']                               # if want not have a email col
                        csv_writer.writerow(line)

5. Parsing names from csv file to html list
    -           import csv
                html_output = ''
                names = []                        

                with open('input_csv_file, 'r') as data_file:
                    csv_data = csv.reader(data_file)

                    # since 1st line has haeders and 2nd line has bad data we wnat to remove it
                    next(csv_data)                          # removing 1st line
                    next(csv_data)                          # removing 2nd line 

                    for line in csv_data:
                        # to stop where we find the condition
                        if line[0] == 'No Reward'
                            break
                        names.append(f'{line[0]} {line[1]}')
                
                for name in names:
                    print(name)
                
                html_output += f'<p>There are currently {len(names)} public contribution. ThankYou!!</p>'
                html_output += '\n <ul>'

                for name in names:
                    html_output += f'\n <li>name</li>'
                
                html_output += '\n </ul>'
                print(html_output)

    - **using DictReader**
    -           import csv
                html_output = ''
                names = []                        

                with open('input_csv_file, 'r') as data_file:
                    csv_data = csv.DictReader(data_file)

                    # since 1st line has bad data we wnat to remove it
                    next(csv_data)                          # removing 1st line 

                    for line in csv_data:
                        # to stop where we find the condition
                        if line['FirstName'] == 'No Reward'
                            break
                        names.append(f'{line['FirstName']} {line['LastName']}')
                
                for name in names:
                    print(name)
                
                html_output += f'<p>There are currently {len(names)} public contribution. ThankYou!!</p>'
                html_output += '\n <ul>'

                for name in names:
                    html_output += f'\n <li>name</li>'
                
                html_output += '\n </ul>'
                print(html_output)
